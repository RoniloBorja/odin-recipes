  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 kg pork belly, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar (or brown sugar)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pineapple chunks (with juice)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup banana blossom (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dried salted black beans (tausi)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, to thicken sauce)</li>
    <li>Fish sauce or salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Procedure:</h2>
  <p>Start by heating oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté onions, garlic, and bay leaves until fragrant and softened. Add the pork belly cubes and cook until browned on all sides. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and pineapple chunks (with its juice), and stir to combine.</p>

  <p>Pour in the vinegar, water, and dried salted black beans (tausi). Stir and let it simmer over low heat for about 30–45 minutes, or until the pork becomes tender. Add the banana blossom (if using), and continue to simmer for an additional 10–15 minutes. Season with fish sauce or salt and ground black pepper to taste.</p>

  <p>If you prefer a thicker sauce, dissolve cornstarch in a small amount of water and stir it into the dish, letting it cook for an additional 5 minutes until the sauce thickens. Serve hot with steamed rice.</p>
