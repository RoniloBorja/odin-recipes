  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 kg chicken, cut into serving pieces</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 thumb-sized ginger, sliced thinly</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
    <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>1 cup water or chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot, sliced (optional)</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
    <li>1 small can (165 ml) coconut cream or additional coconut milk (optional)</li>
    <li>Fish sauce or salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Procedure:</h2>
  <p>To make Filipino-style chicken curry, start by heating oil in a large pan over medium heat. Saut√© the chopped onions, minced garlic, and thinly sliced ginger until the onions turn translucent and the mixture becomes aromatic. Add the chicken pieces and cook them until they are lightly browned on all sides. Sprinkle in the curry powder, stirring well to evenly coat the chicken, and continue cooking for about 2 to 3 minutes to release the flavor of the spices.</p>

  <p>Next, pour in the coconut milk and water (or chicken broth), then bring the mixture to a boil. Once it boils, reduce the heat and let it simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes. Add the cubed potatoes and sliced carrots, then continue to simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. After that, stir in the sliced red and green bell peppers and let them cook for 3 to 5 minutes, just until they are slightly softened but still vibrant.</p>

  <p>Season the curry with fish sauce or salt and ground black pepper to taste. For a richer and creamier sauce, you can stir in some coconut cream and let it simmer gently for a few more minutes, making sure not to let it boil vigorously to avoid curdling. Once done, serve the chicken curry hot over steamed white rice.</p>
