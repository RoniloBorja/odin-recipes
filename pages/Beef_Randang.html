  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 kg beef (chuck or brisket), cut into cubes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 thumb-sized ginger, minced</li>
    <li>1 thumb-sized turmeric, minced (or 1 tbsp turmeric powder)</li>
    <li>2–3 red chili peppers, chopped (optional, for spice)</li>
    <li>1 can (400 ml) coconut milk</li>
    <li>1 cup water or beef broth</li>
    <li>3–4 kaffir lime leaves</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tamarind paste (or lemon juice, as substitute)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Procedure:</h2>
  <p>In a large pot, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Sauté the chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and minced turmeric (or turmeric powder) until fragrant and the onions soften. Add the chopped chili peppers, ground coriander, cumin, and cinnamon, and stir for about 2 minutes to release the spice flavors.</p>

  <p>Add the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides. Pour in the coconut milk, water (or beef broth), kaffir lime leaves, and bay leaves. Stir in the soy sauce, brown sugar, and tamarind paste (or lemon juice). Bring the mixture to a simmer, cover, and cook for 1.5–2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened. Stir occasionally, and add more water if necessary to prevent the mixture from drying out.</p>

  <p>Once the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened to your liking, season with salt to taste. Remove the bay leaves and kaffir lime leaves before serving. Serve the beef rendang with steamed rice or flatbread.</p>
